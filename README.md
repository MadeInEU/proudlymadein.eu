###What does 'in the European Union' mean?

We need to set some rules whether a project needs to be fully done inside the Union, or only partially? Whether a project done partially abroad but by Europeans will be accepted?

###Reciprocity

We are going to introduce projects, so will we require that websites gives us a link back?

##Language

English is for use the easier to work on and communicate.

The website is going to be translated in as many languages as possible, ideally in our [23 official languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union).

##License

So far, released under MIT License.
